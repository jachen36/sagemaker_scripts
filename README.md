# Useful scripts for AWS SageMaker 

Other useful scripts from official aws's github [amazon-sagemaker-examples](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples)

Also the scripts will have a lot of comments to help explain what is going on and for further development. 

## auto-shutdown 

The purpose of this script is to shutdown sagemaker when jupyter is idling. This can help with cost saving. 

The scripts provide by aws doesn't work and is not useful friendly so I created my own. 


## on-start

A script that can be used in the lifecycle config that will setup the notebook instance the way I want it.
